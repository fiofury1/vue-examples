We saw the 'v-html' directive in the introduction to Vue, but here we show it's versatility.

You can see that within the html, the value of 'v-html' can be a statement.  

In the first example, we show how the value of 'v-html' can be a property of the Vue object.  Vue is directing the browser to insert the value of message into the content of the <p>.

In the second example, we have given a statement that does a simple concatenation for the value of 'v-html'.  

In the third example, we show a statement that calls the 'excited()' method.

In this case we show how you can work with form inputs prior to submitting the form. 

It is common to work with form inputs when a form is submitted.  We've seen in the "v-on" example that we could bind an event to an element like a button and run a method using the form inputs.

Here we show how one way to work with form inputs prior to submission.

In this example, we show a two-way binding between a form input and an HTML element.

By adding the "v-model" directive to the input and assigning it a value of "message", any change to the input value, will result in the change of the "message" property of our Vue instance. 

Since the "message" property is also being used in the HTML through the {{ message }} tag, the value will also be automatically updated.

Also, the value of the form input will change whenever Vue.message change in our JavaScript.

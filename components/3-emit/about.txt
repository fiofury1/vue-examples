SUMMARY:
- A custom event can be defined in Vue.  The event can triggered using $emit.
- $emit is most often used to trigger an event in a a child component.  If the parent is listening for the event, methods can be triggered for the parent to take action.
- One of the main uses of $emit is to pass data from a child component to a parent component.


COMMENTARY:
- We saw in the props example that the child component can't access the data of it's parent directly.  That said, we can use a prop to pass desired data to the child for display and computation.  Of course,  what if the child needs to pass data to the parent or to change the parent data?  Or what if the child wants to initiate some other action by the parent?

- Since a child component can't change it's parents data directly, a parent has to change it's data itself.  What we can do is have the child tell the parent to take some action.  This is done by having the child trigger an event that the parent is listening to.    

- The parent can listen by adding an event listener to the child component.  When the event is fired off in the child, the parent will then take the desired action tied to the event.  This could be changing the parent data or any action defined by a method.

- This example shows how to put this all together.

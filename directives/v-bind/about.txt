One of Vue's most powerful features is the ability to "bind" the value of html attribues to expressions containing data, methods, and computed properties.  Through this binding, developers can add dynamic behavior to web pages. 

To bind a Vue to an HTML attribute, we use the v-bind directive.

Here we show how to use both the full and shorthand forms of 'v-bind'.  

You might ask why did we not need this notation when using Vue properties and methods within v-html and v-text directives.  This is because these 'attributes' are not standard HTML attribues provided by HTML.  They are special attributes (directives) provided by Vue, so we don't need to add additional syntax to bind to them.

As we've seen in the "basic-template-tag" example, the "v-text" directive tells the browswer that when building the DOM use value for the property specified from the Vue app "app".

So when rendering the tag <p v-text="message1"></> the browswer renders "Hello friends!".

Remember that when using the "v-text" directive the value is treated as text.  This means that html tags will be treated as text as seen in the second example where  <p v-text="message2"></p> gets rendered as "Hello <br> friends!".

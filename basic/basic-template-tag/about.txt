In index.js, we write a vue app that binds to the element "#app".

We give the vue app an attribute called 'message' that corresponds to a tag, called {{ message }}, that we've placed within the "#app" element.

Now when we change the value of 'message' in our JS, the "#app" element is re-rendered with the new value of 'message'. 

We call this "declarative rendering" because the HTML is rendered through JS declarations.

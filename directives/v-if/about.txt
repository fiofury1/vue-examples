Like always we define a Vue app that targets a certain element, in this case the "#app" element.

You'll notice an attribute called "v-if" in the HTML.  Attribues that start with "v-" are special attributes provided by Vue, called "directives", that allow you to control elements in certain ways.

In this case, the "v-if" directive is assigned a value of "seen".

"seen" is an attribute of our vue app.

When we set "seen" is true in our JS, the <span> element will be visible.

When "seen" to false in our JS, the <span> element will not be visible.

Try rendering the page as is.  Then uncomment that statement where we assign seen the value of false, and refresh the page.

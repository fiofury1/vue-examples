Here we create a Vue app, that targets element "#app".

In the data object, we assign values for 'title' and 'todos'.

'title' is just like values we've assigned in the past.  In the HTML, the value of 'title' feeds the tag {{ title }}.

'todos' is a little different.  In this case, it's an array (list in Python speak) of objects with property the 'text' and different values.

Over in the html, we see a new directive, the 'v-for' directive.

In this case, 'v-for' directs the <li> element to repeat itself for every item in the list specified 'todos' using the specific 'text'. 

We also show how we can add an item to our list, which in turn gets rendered in the HTML.

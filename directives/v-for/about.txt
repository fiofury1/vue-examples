Here we show how to do for loops in Vue.  For loops instruct the browser to repeate elements when building the DOM.

For loops are declared using the "v-for" directive.

The "v-for" directive requires an array to loop over.  As the examples show, the array can be a simple array or an array of objects.  The array can even be returned by a method. 

Vue directs the browswer to repeate the element in which the "v-for" directive is defined for every element in the array.  In the examples here, we are defining the for loop in <li> elements, so it is <li> elements that are repeated.

We also show here that the value for each element can be access using tags or "v-html" directive.

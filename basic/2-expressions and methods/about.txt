Just like we can define properties of our Vue object, we can define methods.  

We define our methods by passing a method object to the method property.

You can see that we can call our method from our tags or from our v-html and v-text directives.

You will have an 'ah-ha' momenet when you realize that the contents between the ""'s of directives and between the curly braces of tags are expressions.  This means tha you can do things like call functions and use operators (concatentation, arithmetic, etc.) between them.

Here we show how to do for loops in Vue.

For loops are declared using the "v-for" directive.

The "v-for" directive requires an array to loop over.  Vue directs the browswer to repeate the element in which the "v-for" directive is defined for every element in the array.  In the examples here, are defining the for loop in <li> elements, so it is <li> elements that are repeated.

We also show here that the value for each element can be access using tags or "v-html" directive.

We also show that we can use a function to take our data and return the data as an array.  I'm guessing this can be useful when rendering API data in JSON.

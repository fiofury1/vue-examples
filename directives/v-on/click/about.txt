Here we show how to add an event listener.  In this case, the functionality occurs when a user clicks on a button.  More specifially, we change the HTML displayed.

When using Vue, event listeners are added using the "v-on" directive.  You can see the "v-on" directive has been added to the <button> tag. 

When the user clicks on the button, the method "reverseMessage" runs. 

The reverseMessage method is defined in our Vue app.  

This example shows something to remember about Vue.  We can define both data and methods associated with our Vue object.

Like data was defined by passing a data object to Vue constructor, methods are also defined by passing a "method" object to the Vue construtor.

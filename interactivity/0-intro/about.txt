Here we show a basic example of adding interactivity using Vue.

In this example, we show two different ways to add an event listener.  

In each case, the browswer add a listener to a button and a method is called to change the HTML when it is clicked.  (The method reassigns the value of one of our data properties that is linked to a tag in the HTML).

When using Vue, event listeners are added using the "v-on" directive or using the "@" syntax.  

In both cases, When the user clicks on the button, the method "reverseMessage" runs. 

The reverseMessage method is defined in our Vue app.  

This example shows something to remember about Vue.  We can define both data and methods associated with our Vue object.

Like data was defined by passing a data object to Vue constructor, methods are also defined by passing a "method" object to the Vue construtor.

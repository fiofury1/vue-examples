"Props" allow us to pass data into a component.   

If we want to define a prop, we list it in our component definition.

Then, in our HTML, props are used like custom attribues of a component.  By assigning or binding a value to the attribute, the value is passed into the component, becoming a property of that component (just like our data properties)

Here we show examples of increasing complexity.

Note that one of the reasons we need props is because a child component can't access the data of its parent component.

In index.js, we create a Vue app by instantiating a Vue object.

The Vue app will give us the ability to control our HTML through properties and methods of the Vue object.  We'll even see that in more advance cases, we'll use Vue to fully build and control the HTML.

When we instantiate the Vue object, we pass it a JavaScript object as an argument.

Here the properties of the object we pass are "el" and "data".

The "el" property specifies that the Vue object binds to the element "#app".

The "data" property, is another JavaScript object, consiting of a property called "message".  In the HTML, "message" corresponds to the {{ message }} tag found within the "#app" element.

With our Vue object bound to the "#app" element with data property of "message", within JS code/functions we can now control value displayed in {{ message }} like this:

    app.message = "Something new";

We call this "declarative rendering" because the HTML is rendered through JS declarations.

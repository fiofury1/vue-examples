In these examples, we show how to conditionally add elements to the DOM.

The first two examples use the "v-if" directives.  

The third example uses the "v-show" directive.

"v-if" and "v-show" work slightly differently, for "v-if" when the condition is false, it's element is not shown in the DOM.   For "v-show", when it's condition is false, it is shown in the DOM with style="display: none;". 

The fourth example add the conditional logic in the v-html expression using the JavaScript ternary (operator).

This examples is just like the 'basic-template-tag' example, the only difference is that we've defined the delimeters for our tag, rather than using the vue default of curly brackes.

We define the delimiters in index.js using the 'delimeters' property.

The ability to assign delimiters for tags comes in handy when working with a template language like DTL, that also use curly braces.

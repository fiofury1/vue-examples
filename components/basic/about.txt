In this example we show how to define a component that can be used like a re-usable HTML tag.  

This is a basic example to allow you to start developing the mental model of components.

We define components by adding them to the Vue class.  This is called "registering" the component.

Then when we instantiate a Vue instance, the instance will have that component available.

Here the component is called "todo-item" and it has a template defined as '<li>This is a todo</li>'.

Once we've created a Vue app we can use this component anywhere within the HTML of our Vue element using the tag syntax <todo-item></todo-item>.

This is a basic example, and we'll show that there are much more powerful things we can do with components.

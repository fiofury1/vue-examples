In this case we show how you can work with form inputs. 

While going through this example, keep in mind that Vue gives us the ability to write single page applications, where the page loads once and data is sent back to the server by functions/methods in the background.

In this example, we show a two-way binding between a form input and an HTML element.

By adding the "v-model" directive to the input and assigning it a value of "message", any change to the input value, will result in the change of the "message" property of our Vue instance. 

Since the "message" property is also being used in the HTML through the {{ message }} tag, the value will also be automatically updated.

Also, the value of the form input will change whenever Vue.message change in our JavaScript.

Because the value of message can be changed via the form input and within our JavaScript, it's called a two-way binding.

We also an example where we use v-model on a checkbox input.

Here we create a Vue app, that targets element "#app".

In the data object, we assign values for 'title' and 'todos'.

'title' is just like values we've assigned in the past.  In the HTML, the value of 'title' feeds the tag {{ title }}.

'todos' is a little different.  In this case, it's an array (list in Python speak) of values.

Over in the html, we see a new directive, the 'v-for' directive.

In this case, 'v-for' creates a <li> element for every item in the list specified 'todos'. 

We also show how we can add an item to our list, which in turn gets rendered in the HTML.

Here we create a Vue app, that targets element "#app".

In the data object, we assign values for 'title' and 'todos'.

'title' is just like values we've assigned in the past.  When the browser creates the DOM, it will enter the value of 'title' into the tag {{ title }}.

'todos' is a little different.  In this case, it's an array (list in Python speak) of objects each with property of 'text' with a value.

Over in the html, we see a new directive, the 'v-for' directive.

In this case, 'v-for' directs the browser that when creating the DOM, repeat the <li> element for every item in 'todos' its values of 'text'. 

We also show how we can add an item to our list, which in turn gets rendered in the HTML.

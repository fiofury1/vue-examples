Here we show how to add functionality that occurs when a user clicks on a button.  In this case, we change the HTML displayed.

When using Vue, events are tied to HTML elements by using the "v-on" directive.  You can see the "v-on" directive has been added to the <button> tag. 

When the user clicks on the button, the function "reverseMessage" runs. 

The reverseMessage function is defined in our Vue app.  

This example shows something to remember about Vue.  We can define both data and methods associated with our Vue objet.
